0.2 - Core Mods
      Man, what a headache. This is my first time using a core mod so I thought
      there would be problems, but it was a nightmare to figure out what was wrong.
      Just because something works doesn't mean it's for the reason you think it
      does. After some tinkering I am still happy with the result.

0.1 - Mod Creation
      I knew my mod would make creating a mod easier, but this is insane! Hardly
    any work at all, and such a small file. It may be just me or maybe forge, but
    loading up the mod seemed much faster, or at least the initialization steps.
    Now time to add more plants.
